####Using the library

In order to start using vzaar API library

```php
require_once 'Vzaar.php';

Vzaar::$token = 'VZAAR_API_TOKEN';
Vzaar::$secret = 'VZAAR_USERNAME';
```

In order to use vzaar API, you need to have a valid user name and API token that you can get from your vzaar dashboard at [http://vzaar.com/settings/](http://vzaar.com/settings/]third_party.)

The very next thing you would want to do is to check if your account actually works and operational and you can do it by simple calling _whoAmI_:

```php
echo(Vzaar::whoAmI());
```

If it returns you your vzaar username, - we are good to go.

####User Details

>This API call returns the user's public details along with it's relevant metadata. It also contains vzaar Account ID that you can use in _getAccountDetails_ call.

```php
print_r(Vzaar::getUserDetails('VZAAR_USERNAME'));
```

Where _VZAAR_USERNAME_ is the vzaar username. Result of this call will be an object of UserDetails type.

####Account Details

>This API call returns the details and rights for each vzaar subscription account type along with it's relevant metadata. This will show the details of the packages available here: [http://vzaar.com/pricing](http://vzaar.com/pricing)

Result of this call will be an object of AccountDetails type.

####Video List

```php
print_r(Vzaar::getVideoList('VZAAR_USERNAME', true, 10));
```

####Video Details

```php
print_r(Vzaar::getVideoDetails(VZAAR_VIDEO_ID, true));
```

Where _VZAAR_VIDEO_ID_ is unique vzaar video ID assigned to a video after its processing.

####Upload Signature

>In some cases you might need to not perform actual uploading from API but to use some third-party uploaders, like S3_Upload widget, or any other, so you would need to get only upload signature for it.

```php
print_r(Vzaar::getUploadSignature());
```

####Uploading video

>Upload video from local drive directly to Amazon S3 bucket. Use this method when you build desktop apps or when you upload videos to vzaar directly from your server.

```php
$filename = '548.mov'; // the file must be located in the same directory as the script. If not use full disk path

$file = getcwd() . '\\' . $filename;
echo('file to upload: ' . $file);
$result=Vzaar::uploadVideo($file);
echo($result);
```

####Uploading videos using URLs

>Uploading a new video or replacing an existing one from an URL

```php
$url = "http://somewebsite.com/my_video.mp4";
echo('uploading video from url: ' . $url);
$video_id=Vzaar::uploadLink($url);
echo($video_id);
```

####Uploading thumbnails

>Upload thumbnails for a video by using the video id.

```php
$video_id = 123;

$thumb_path = "/home/user/my_image.jpg";
echo('uploading thumbnail for video:' . $video_id . ', file path:' . $thumb_path);
$result=Vzaar::uploadThumbnail($video_id, $thumb_path);
echo($result);
```

####Processing video

>This API call tells the vzaar system to process a newly uploaded video. This will encode it if necessary and then provide a vzaar video ID back.

```php
$apireply = Vzaar::processVideo(GUID, VIDEO_TITLE, VIDEO_DESCRIPTION, Profile::Original); 
echo($apireply)
```
